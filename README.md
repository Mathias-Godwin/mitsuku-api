An API for [Mitsuku](https://www.pandorabots.com/mitsuku/), a chatbot.

This is _not_ official.  It's just a little project that I'm working
on. Usage:
```sh
python3 main.py [file]
```
file: input to chatbot.  If not found, you will enter it in stdin.

As for now, it just outputs the response to stdout.

You need the following stuff for it to work:
- Any distribution of Python, version 3.6 or above
- beautifulsoup4
- lxml
- requests
- Internet access
